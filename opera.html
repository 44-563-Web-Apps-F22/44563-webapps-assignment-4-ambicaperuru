        <h2>Utopia Limited - Act 2</h2>
        <h3>Scene — Throne Room in the Palace.  Night.  Fitzbattleaxe
            discovered, singing to Zara.</h3>
        <pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
            Fitz.:    Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
  Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
  with the others.  Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
  idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
  full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
  never dreamt of!

  Zara:     But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
  ef-fected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
  that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
  applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
  man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
  restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
  christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
  Prospectus!

  Fitz.:    Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can
  trans-mute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.

  Zara:     Reform has not stopped here—it has been applied
  even to the costume of our people.  Discarding their own barbaric
  dress, the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the taste-
  ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety. Scaphio and
  Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the whole of Utopia
  with clothing designed upon the most approved English
  models—and the first Drawing-Room under the new state of
  things is to be held here this evening.

  Fitz.:    But Drawing-Rooms are always held in the afternoon.

  Zara:     Ah, we've improved upon that.  We all look so much
  better by candlelight!  And when I tell you, dearest, that my
  Court train has just arrived, you will understand that I am long-
  ing to go and try it on.

  Fitz.:    Then we must part?

  Zara:     Necessarily, for a time.

  Fitz.:    Just as I wanted to tell you, with all the passionate
  enthu-siasm of my nature, how deeply, how devotedly I love you!

  Zara:     Hush!  Are these the accents of a heart that really
  feels? True love does not indulge in declamation—its voice
  is sweet, and soft, and low.  The west wind whispers when he woos
  the poplars!

                      DUET — Zara and Fitzbattleaxe.

  Zara:          Words of love too loudly spoken
                      Ring their own untimely knell;
                 Noisy vows are rudely broken,
                      Soft the song of Philomel.
                 Whisper sweetly, whisper slowly,
                      Hour by hour and day by day;
                 Sweet and low as accents holy
                      Are the notes of lover's lay.

  Both:          Sweet and low, etc.

  Fitz:          Let the conqueror, flushed with glory,
                      Bid his noisy clarions bray;
                 Lovers tell their artless story
                      In a whispered virelay.
                 False is he whose vows alluring
                      Make the listening echoes ring;
                 Sweet and low when all-enduring
                      Are the songs that lovers sing!

  Both:          Sweet and low, etc.

  (Exit Zara. Enter King dressed as Field-Marshal.)

  King:     To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
  use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
  perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
  all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
  sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
  Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
  impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
  Articles of Association?

  Fitz.:    Sir, they are here.

  (Enter Lord Dramaleigh, Captain Corcoran, Sir Bailey Barre, Mr.
  Blushington, and Mr. Goldbury from different entrances.)

  King:     Oh!  (Addressing them)  Gentlemen, our daughter holds
  her first Drawing-Room in half an hour, and we shall have time to
  make our half-yearly report in the interval.  I am neces-sarily
  unfamiliar with the forms of an English Cabinet
  Council—perhaps the Lord Chamberlain will kindly put us in
  the way of doing the thing properly, and with due regard to the
  solemnity of the occasion.

  Lord D.:  Certainly—nothing simpler.  Kindly bring your
  chairs forward—His Majesty will, of course, preside.

  (They range their chairs across stage like Christy Minstrels.
  King sits center, Lord Dramaleigh on his left, Mr. Goldbury on his
  right, Captain Corcoran left of Lord Dramaleigh, Captain
  Fitzbattleaxe right of Mr. Goldbury, Mr. Blushington extreme
  right, Sir Bailey Barre extreme left.)

  King:     Like this?

  Lord D.:  Like this.

  King:     We take your word for it that this is all right.  You
  are not making fun of us?  This is in accordance with the prac-
  tice at the Court of St. James's?

  Lord D.:  Well, it is in accordance with the practice at the Court
  of St. James's Hall.

  King:     Oh! it seems odd, but never mind.

  SONG — King.

  Society has quite forsaken all her wicked courses. Which empties
  our police courts, and abolishes divorces.

  Chorus:   Divorce is nearly obsolete in England.

  King:     No tolerance we show to undeserving rank and splendour;
  For the higher his position is, the greater the offender.

  Chorus:   That's a maxim that is prevalent in England.

  King:     No peeress at our drawing-room before the Presence
  passes Who wouldn't be accepted by the lower middle-classes. Each
  shady dame, whatever be her rank, is bowed out neatly.

  Chorus:   In short, this happy country has been Anglicized
  completely Is really is surprising What a thorough Anglicizing We
  have brought about—Utopia's quite another land; In her
  enterprising movements, She is England—with improvements,
  Which we dutifully offer to our mother-land!

  King:     Our city we have beautified—we've done it willy-
  nilly— And all that isn't Belgrave Square is Strand and
  Piccadilly.

  Chorus:        We haven't any slummeries in England!

  King:     The chamberlain our native stage has purged beyond a
  question. Of "risky" situation and indelicate suggestion; No piece
  is tolerated if it's costumed indiscreetly—

  Chorus:        In short this happy country has been Anglicized
  com-pletely! It really is surprising, etc.

  King:     Our peerage we've remodelled on an intellectual basis,
  Which certainly is rough on our hereditary races—

  Chorus:        We are going to remodel it in England.

  King:     The Brewers and the Cotton Lords no longer seek
  admission, And literary merit meets with proper recognition—

  Chorus:        As literary merit does in England!

  King:     Who knows but we may count among our intellectual
  chickens, Like you, an Earl of Thackery and p'r'aps a Duke of
  Dickens— Lord Fildes and Viscount Millais (when they come)
  we'll welcome sweetly—

  Chorus:   In short, this happy country has been Anglicized
  completely! It really is surprising, etc.

  (At the end all rise and replace their chairs.)

  King:     Now, then, for our first Drawing-Room.  Where are the
  Prin-cesses?  What an extraordinary thing it is that since Euro-
  pean looking-glasses have been supplied to the Royal bed-rooms my
  daughters are invariably late!

  Lord D.:  Sir, their Royal Highnesses await your pleasure in the
  Ante-room.

  King:     Oh.  Then request them to do us the favor to enter at
  once.

  (Enter all the Royal Household, including (besides the Lord
  Chamber-lain) the Vice-Chamberlain, the Master of the Horse, the
  Master of the Buckhounds, the Lord High Treasurer, the Lord
  Steward, the Comptroller of the Household, the Lord-in-Waiting,
  the Field Officer in Brigade Waiting, the Gold and Silver Stick,
  and the Gentlemen Ushers.  Then enter the three Princesses (their
  trains carried by Pages of Honor), Lady Sophy, and the Ladies-in-
  Waiting.)

  King:     My daughters, we are about to attempt a very solemn
  ceremo-nial, so no giggling, if you please.  Now, my Lord Chamber-
  lain, we are ready.

  Lord D.:  Then, ladies and gentlemen, places, if you please.  His
  Maj-esty will take his place in front of the throne, and will be
  so obliging as to embrace all the debutantes.  (LADY SOPHY much
  shocked.)

  King:     What—must I really?

  Lord D.:  Absolutely indispensable.

  King:     More jam for the Palace Peeper!

  (The King takes his place in front of the throne, the Princess
  Zara on his left, the two younger Princesses on the left of Zara.)

  King:     Now, is every one in his place?

  Lord D.:  Every one is in his place.

  King:     Then let the revels commence.

  (Enter the ladies attending the Drawing-Room.  They give their
  cards to the Groom-in-Waiting, who passes them to the Lord-in-
  Waiting, who passes them to the Vice-Chamberlain, who passes them
  to the Lord Chamberlain, who reads the names to the King as each
  lady approaches.  The ladies curtsey in succession to the King and
  the three Princesses, and pass out.  When all the presentations
  have been accomplished, the King, Princesses, and Lady Sophy come
  forward, and all the ladies re-enter.)

                            RECITATIVE — King

            This ceremonial our wish displays
            To copy all Great Britain's courtly ways.
            Though lofty aims catastrophe entail,
            We'll gloriously succeed or nobly fail!

                        UNACCOMPANIED CHORUS

            Eagle High in Cloudland soaring—
                 Sparrow twittering on a reed—
            Tiger in the jungle roaring—
                 Frightened fawn in grassy mead—
            Let the eagle, not the sparrow,
            Be the object of your arrow—
                 Fix the tiger with your eye—
                 Pass the fawn in pity by.
                 Glory then will crown the day—
                 Glory, glory, anyway!

                                                               (Exit all.)

  Enter Scaphio and Phantis, now dressed as judges in red and ermine
  robes and undress wigs.  They come down stage melodramatically
  — working together.

                       DUET — Scaphio and Phantis.

  Sca.:               With fury deep we burn

  Phan.:                                            We do—

  Sca.:               We fume with smothered rage—

  Phan.:                                            We do—

  Sca.:               These Englishmen who rule supreme,
                      Their undertaking they redeem
                      By stifling every harmless scheme
                           In which we both engage—

  Phan.:                                            They do—

  Sca.:                    In which we both engage—

  Phan.:              We think it is our turn—

  Sca.:                                             We do—

  Phan.:              We think our turn has come—

  Sca.:                                             We do.

  Phan.:              These Englishmen, they must prepare
                      To seek at once their native air.
                      The King as heretofore, we swear,
                      Shall be beneath our thumb—

  Sca.:                                             He shall—

  Phan.:              Shall be beneath out thumb—

  Sca.:                                             He shall.

  Both: (with great energy)
                      For this mustn't be, and this won't do.
                      If you'll back me, then I'll back you,
                                No, this won't do,
                                No, this mustn't be.
                         With fury deep we burn...

                              Enter the King.

  King:     Gentlemen, gentlemen—really!  This unseemly
  display of energy within the Royal precincts is altogether
  unpardon-able.  Pray, what do you complain of?

  Scaphio:  (furiously)  What do we complain of?  Why, through the
  innovations introduced by the Flowers of Progress all our harmless
  schemes for making a provision for our old age are ruined.  Our
  Matrimonial Agency is at a standstill, our Cheap Sherry business
  is in bankruptcy, our Army Clothing contracts are paralyzed, and
  even our Society paper, the Palace Peeper, is practically defunct!

  King:     Defunct?  Is that so?  Dear, dear, I am truly sorry.

  Scaphio:  Are you aware that Sir Bailey Barre has introduced a law
  of libel by which all editors of scurrilous newspapers are pub-
  licly flogged—as in England?  And six of our editors have
  resigned in succession!  Now, the editor of a scurrilous paper can
  stand a good deal—he takes a private thrashing as a matter
  of course—it's considered in his salary—but no
  gentleman likes to be publicly flogged.

  King:     Naturally.  I shouldn't like it myself.

  Phantis:  Then our Burlesque Theater is absolutely ruined!

  King:     Dear me.  Well, theatrical property is not what it was.

  Phantis:  Are you aware that the Lord Chamberlain, who has his own
  views as to the best means of elevating the national drama, has
  declined to license any play that is not in blank verse and three
  hundred years old—as in England?

  Scaphio:  And as if that wasn't enough, the County Councillor has
  or-dered a four-foot wall to be built up right across the
  proscenium, in case of fire—as in England.

  Phantis:  It's so hard on the company—who are liable to be
  roasted alive—and this has to be met by enormously increased
  salaries—as in England.

  Scaphio:  You probably know that we've contracted to supply the
  entire nation with a complete English outfit.  But perhaps you do
  not know that, when we send in our bills, our customers plead
  liability limited to a declared capital of eighteenpence, and
  apply to be dealt with under the Winding-up Act—as in
  England?

  King:     Really, gentlemen, this is very irregular.  If you will
  be so good as to formulate a detailed list of your grievances in
  writing, addressed to the Secretary of Utopia Limited, they will
  be laid before the Board, in due course, at their next monthly
  meeting.

  Scaphio:  Are we to understand that we are defied?

  King:     That is the idea I intended to convey.

  Phantis:  Defied!  We are defied!

  Scaphio:  (furiously)  Take care—you know our powers.
  Trifle with us, and you die!

                    TRIO — Scaphio, Phantis, and King.

  Sca.:     If you think that, when banded in unity,
            We may both be defied with impunity,
                 You are sadly misled of a verity!

  Phan.:    If you value repose and tranquility,
            You'll revert to a state of docility,
                 Or prepare to regret your temerity!

  King.:    If my speech is unduly refractory
            You will find it a course satisfactory
                 At an early Board meeting to show it up.
            Though if proper excuse you can trump any,
            You may wind up a Limited Company,
                 You cannot conveniently blow it up!

              (Scaphio and Phantis thoroughly baffled)

  King.:  (Dancing quietly)
            Whene'er I chance to baffle you
            I, also, dance a step or two—
            Of this now guess the hidden sense:

  (Scaphio and Phantis consider the question as King continues
  dancing quietly—then give it up.)

            It means complete indifference!

  Sca. and Phan.:     Of course it does—indifference!
                      It means complete indifference!

  (King dancing quietly. Sca. and Phan. dancing furiously.)

  Sca. and Phan.:     As we've a dance for every mood
                      With pas de trois we will conclude,
                      What this may mean you all may guess—
                      It typifies remorselessness!

  King.:              It means unruffled cheerfulness!

  (King dances off placidly as Scaphio and Phantis dance furiously.)

  Phantis:  (breathless)  He's right—we are helpless!  He's no
  longer a human being—he's a Corporation, and so long as he
  confines himself to his Articles of Association we can't touch
  him! What are we to do?

  Scaphio:  Do?  Raise a Revolution, repeal the Act of Sixty-Two,
  recon-vert him into an individual, and insist on his immediate ex-
  plosion!  (Tarara enters.)  Tarara, come here; you're the very man
  we want.

  Tarara:   Certainly, allow me.  (Offers a cracker to each; they
  snatch them away impatiently.)  That's rude.

  Scaphio:  We have no time for idle forms.  You wish to succeed to
  the throne?

  Tarara:   Naturally.

  Scaphio:  Then you won't unless you join us.  The King has defied
  us, and, as matters stand, we are helpless.  So are you.  We must
  devise some plot at once to bring the people about his ears.

  Tarara:   A plot?

  Phantis:  Yes, a plot of superhuman subtlety.  Have you such a
  thing about you?

  Tarara:   (feeling)  No, I think not.  No.  There's one on my
  dressing-table.

  Scaphio:  We can't wait—we must concoct one at once, and put
  it into execution without delay.  There is not a moment to spare!
