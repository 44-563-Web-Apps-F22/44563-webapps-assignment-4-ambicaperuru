        <p class="speech Fitz">  False is he whose vows alluring
                      Make the listening echoes ring;
                 Sweet and low when all-enduring
                      Are the songs that lovers sing! </p>

         <p class="direction"> (Exit Zara. Enter King dressed as Field-Marshal.)</p>

         <h6 class="name">King:</h6>
         <p class="speech King"> To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
  use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
  perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
  all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
  sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
  Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
  impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
  Articles of Association?</p>

        <h6 class="name">Fitz:</h6>
        <p class="speech Fitz">Sir, they are here.</p>    

       <p class="direction">(Enter Lord Dramaleigh, Captain Corcoran, Sir Bailey Barre, Mr.
        Blushington, and Mr. Goldbury from different entrances.)</p>
